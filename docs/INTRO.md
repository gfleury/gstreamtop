# General

Run real-time analitical SQL queries (aggregated) on text streams, mapping fields with REGEX or as CSV or JSON.

Allow use of GROUP BY, ORDER BY, LIMIT and WHERE.

Allow use of LEFT JOIN on other streams and external datasources to enrich the data.

Allow use of WINDOW mechanism to aggregate only over certain period time.


## TODOs
